        <h1>What is a paragraph?</h1>
        <p>
          Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define
          paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five
          sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though,
          the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a
          paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single
          sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and
          appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a
          paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly
          journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.
          Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that
          support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the
          “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of
          the paragraph.
        </p>
        <h2>How do I decide what to put in a paragraph?</h2>
        <p>
          Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular
          paragraph will be, you must first decide on an argument and a working
          thesis statement for your paper. What is the most important idea that
          you are trying to convey to your reader? The information in each
          paragraph must be related to that idea. In other words, your
          paragraphs should remind your reader that there is a recurrent
          relationship between your thesis and the information in each
          paragraph. A working thesis functions like a seed from which your
          paper, and your ideas, will grow. The whole process is an organic
          one—a natural progression from a seed to a full-blown paper where
          there are direct, familial relationships between all of the ideas in
          the paper.
        </p>
        <h3>How do I organize a paragraph?</h3>
        <p>
          There are many different ways to organize a paragraph. The
          organization you choose will depend on the controlling idea of the
          paragraph. Below are a few possibilities for organization, with links
          to brief examples: Narration: Tell a story. Go chronologically, from
          start to finish. (See an example.) Description: Provide specific
          details about what something looks, smells, tastes, sounds, or feels
          like. Organize spatially, in order of appearance, or by topic. (See an
          example.) Process: Explain how something works, step by step. Perhaps
          follow a sequence—first, second, third. (See an example.)
          Classification: Separate into groups or explain the various parts of a
          topic. (See an example.) Illustration: Give examples and explain how
          those examples support your point. (See an example in the 5-step
          process below.)
        </p>
        <p>
          From the list above, let’s choose “illustration” as our rhetorical
          purpose. We’ll walk through a 5-step process for building a paragraph
          that illustrates a point in an argument. For each step there is an
          explanation and example. Our example paragraph will be about human
          misconceptions of piranhas.
